# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Project

## Overview
This project is an implementation of a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** with an AI opponent using the **Minimax Algorithm**. The AI is designed to make optimal moves and ensures a challenging experience for the user.

The project is built with Python and features a graphical user interface (GUI) created using **Tkinter**. Players take turns playing against the AI, with the AI always aiming to either win or draw the game.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Interactive gameplay using Tkinter buttons.
- **AI Opponent**: Implements the Minimax algorithm for optimal decision-making.
- **Winner Detection**: Highlights the winning combination when the game is over.
- **Draw Detection**: Declares the game a draw if no moves are left.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Run


1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayebee11/tictactoe_minimaxalgo.git
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
   cd repository-name
```

Run the script:
```bash
   python tictactoe.py
```

How It Works
The player (X) always starts the game.
The AI (O) uses the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best possible move.
The game ends when either the player or the AI wins, or the board is full (draw).
